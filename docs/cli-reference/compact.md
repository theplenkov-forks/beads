{/* AUTO-GENERATED: do not edit manually */}

Generated from `bd help --doc compact`.

Squash Dolt commits older than N days into a single commit.

Recent commits (within the retention window) are preserved via cherry-pick.
This reduces Dolt storage overhead from auto-commit history while keeping
recent change tracking intact.

For semantic issue compaction (summarizing closed issues), use 'bd admin compact'.
For full history squash, use 'bd flatten'.

How it works:
  1. Identifies commits older than --days threshold
  2. Creates a squashed base commit from all old history
  3. Cherry-picks recent commits on top
  4. Swaps main branch to the compacted version
  5. Prunes remote-tracking refs (they would keep the old history alive;
     the next push or fetch re-creates them at the new tip)
  6. Runs a full Dolt GC (all storage generations) to reclaim the old history

The GC pass is a full collection: Dolt storage is generational, and a default
GC never revisits data an earlier GC moved to the old generation. On any store
that has been GC'd before (bd gc, or a previous flatten or compact), only a
full collection reclaims the squashed history. A full GC can take minutes on
multi-gigabyte stores.

Examples:
  bd compact --dry-run               # Preview: show commit breakdown
  bd compact --force                 # Squash commits older than 30 days
  bd compact --days 7 --force        # Keep only last 7 days of history
  bd compact --days 90 --force       # Conservative: squash 90+ day old commits

```
bd compact [flags]
```

**Flags:**

```
      --days int   Keep commits newer than N days (default 30)
      --dry-run    Preview without making changes
  -f, --force      Confirm commit squash
```
