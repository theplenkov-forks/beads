Generated from `bd help --doc dolt`.

Configure and manage Dolt database settings and server lifecycle.

Beads runs Dolt embedded (in-process) by default: there is no sql-server and
nothing is auto-started. A database only uses a dolt sql-server when it is
configured for one: shared-server mode, an explicit server mode, or a
non-localhost dolt_server_host. The server-only commands below fail with
"not supported in embedded mode (no Dolt server)" on an embedded database.

Server lifecycle (server mode only):
  bd dolt start        Start the Dolt server for this project
  bd dolt stop         Stop the Dolt server for this project

Diagnostics (both modes):
  bd dolt status       Show Dolt engine status (embedded: in-process, data dir)
  bd dolt show         Show current Dolt configuration with connection test

Configuration (server mode only):
  bd dolt set &lt;k&gt; &lt;v&gt;  Set a configuration value
  bd dolt test         Test server connection

Version control:
  bd dolt commit       Commit pending changes
  bd dolt push         Push commits to Dolt remote
  bd dolt pull         Pull commits from Dolt remote

Remote management:
  bd dolt remote add &lt;name&gt; &lt;url&gt;   Add a Dolt remote
  bd dolt remote list                List configured remotes
  bd dolt remote remove &lt;name&gt;       Remove a Dolt remote

Configuration keys for 'bd dolt set':
  database  Database name (default: issue prefix or "beads")
  host      Server host (default: 127.0.0.1)
  port      Server port (auto-detected; override with bd dolt set port &lt;N&gt;)
  user      MySQL user (default: root)
  data-dir  Custom dolt data directory (absolute path; default: .beads/dolt)

Remote server authentication (password + TLS) is NOT stored via 'bd dolt set'
(keeps secrets out of metadata.json). Configure them with:

  BEADS_DOLT_PASSWORD       Server password (highest priority)
  BEADS_DOLT_SERVER_TLS     Enable TLS (set to "1" or "true")
  BEADS_DOLT_SERVER_USER    MySQL user override (else use 'bd dolt set user')
  BEADS_CREDENTIALS_FILE    Optional path to credentials file

  Default credentials file: ~/.config/beads/credentials (Linux/macOS)
                            %APPDATA%\beads\credentials (Windows)
  Format (INI, section = host:port of the resolved connection):
    [127.0.0.1:3307]
    password = secret

  Password resolution: BEADS_DOLT_PASSWORD → credentials [host:port] → empty.
  Full reference: docs/architecture/dolt.md (Environment Variables / Credentials).

Flags for 'bd dolt set':
  --update-config  Also write to config.yaml for team-wide defaults

Examples:
  bd dolt set database myproject
  bd dolt set host 192.168.1.100 --update-config
  bd dolt set data-dir /home/user/.beads-dolt/myproject
  `export BEADS_DOLT_PASSWORD=... BEADS_DOLT_SERVER_TLS=1`
  bd dolt test

```
bd dolt [command]
```

## bd dolt clean-databases

Identify and drop leftover test and agent databases that accumulate
on the shared Dolt server from interrupted test runs and terminated agents.

Stale database prefixes: testdb_*, beads_test*, beads_pt*, beads_vr*, doctest_*, doctortest_*, benchdb_*

These waste server memory and can degrade performance under concurrent load.
Use --dry-run to see what would be dropped without actually dropping.

DROP DATABASE only marks a database as dropped; Dolt keeps its directory
under .dolt_dropped_databases/ so it can be restored with
CALL DOLT_UNDROP(name) until an explicit purge — disk is not reclaimed
until then. Pass --purge-dropped to run CALL DOLT_PURGE_DROPPED_DATABASES()
after cleanup.

--purge-dropped is SERVER-GLOBAL and IRREVERSIBLE. Dolt has no way to scope
the purge to only the databases this run dropped: it permanently deletes
every dropped-but-not-yet-purged database on the server, including ones
dropped by something else entirely (e.g. an operator's accidental
DROP DATABASE on an unrelated database that was still recoverable via
DOLT_UNDROP). It also purges pre-existing residue from earlier
clean-databases runs even if this run finds no stale databases to drop.
Only pass it when nothing else on the server may be relying on DOLT_UNDROP
recovery.

```
bd dolt clean-databases [flags]
```

**Flags:**

```
      --dry-run         Show what would be dropped without dropping
      --purge-dropped   After dropping, also run CALL DOLT_PURGE_DROPPED_DATABASES() — server-global and irreversible, see --help
```

## bd dolt commit

Create a Dolt commit from any uncommitted changes in the working set.

This is the primary commit point for batch mode. When auto-commit is set to
"batch", changes accumulate in the working set across multiple bd commands and
are committed together here with a descriptive summary message.

Also useful before push operations that require a clean working set, or when
auto-commit was off or changes were made externally.

For more options (--stdin, custom messages), see: bd vc commit

```
bd dolt commit [flags]
```

**Flags:**

```
  -m, --message string   Commit message (default: auto-generated)
```

## bd dolt killall

Find and kill orphan dolt sql-server processes not tracked by the
canonical PID file for the current repo's Dolt data directory.

Under an orchestrator, the canonical server lives at $GT_ROOT/.beads/. Any other
dolt sql-server processes using that shared data directory are considered
orphans and will be killed.

In standalone mode, only dolt sql-server processes using the current
project's Dolt data directory are eligible for cleanup. Other projects'
servers are preserved.

```
bd dolt killall [flags]
```

## bd dolt pull

Pull commits from the configured Dolt remote into the local database.

Requires a Dolt remote to be configured in the database directory.
For Hosted Dolt, set DOLT_REMOTE_USER and DOLT_REMOTE_PASSWORD environment
variables for authentication.

Use --remote to pull from a specific named remote instead of the default.
The remote must already exist (see 'bd dolt remote add').

Use --strategy ours|theirs to resolve conflicts the auto-resolver declines
(e.g. both sides edited the same issue since the last sync) instead of
aborting the pull for manual resolution. Embedded storage only (#4992); on
server-mode/sql-server storage use 'bd conflicts resolve' after a pull that
reports conflicts.

Use --auth to select how bd authenticates git-over-HTTP(S) remotes
(git+https://, git+http://). The default (auto) tries the gh CLI, then
the glab CLI, then OAuth if a client_id is configured; when none
applies, git's own configured credential helpers are used. Use 'none'
to disable wrapping. SSH, git://, file, and non-git Dolt remotes
(DoltHub, Hosted Dolt, remotesapi https://) are never wrapped.
See 'bd github-sync'.

```
bd dolt pull [flags]
```

**Flags:**

```
      --auth string       Auth provider for remote git operations: gh, glab, oauth, none, or auto (default "auto")
      --remote string     Pull from a specific named remote instead of the default
      --strategy string   Conflict resolution strategy for conflicts the auto-resolver declines: 'ours' or 'theirs' (embedded storage only, #4992)
```

## bd dolt push

Push local Dolt commits to the configured remote.

Requires a Dolt remote to be configured in the database directory. With no
remote configured, bd can adopt one derived from git origin — only with
consent: interactively, or via --yes; --no-adopt or BD_NO_REMOTE_ADOPT=1
disables adoption entirely.
For Hosted Dolt, set DOLT_REMOTE_USER and DOLT_REMOTE_PASSWORD environment
variables for authentication.

Use --force to overwrite remote changes (e.g., when the remote has
uncommitted changes in its working set).

Use --remote to push to a specific named remote instead of the default.
The remote must already exist (see 'bd dolt remote add').

Use --auth to select how bd authenticates git-over-HTTP(S) remotes
(git+https://, git+http://). The default (auto) tries the gh CLI, then
the glab CLI, then OAuth if a client_id is configured; when none
applies, git's own configured credential helpers are used. Use 'none'
to disable wrapping. SSH, git://, file, and non-git Dolt remotes
(DoltHub, Hosted Dolt, remotesapi https://) are never wrapped.
See 'bd github-sync'.

```
bd dolt push [flags]
```

**Flags:**

```
      --auth string     Auth provider for remote git operations: gh, glab, oauth, none, or auto (default "auto")
      --force           Force push (overwrite remote changes)
      --no-adopt        Never derive a Dolt remote from git origin (also BD_NO_REMOTE_ADOPT=1)
      --remote string   Push to a specific named remote instead of the default
  -y, --yes             Consent to adopting a Dolt remote derived from git origin when none is configured
```

## bd dolt remote

Manage Dolt remotes for push/pull replication.

Subcommands:
  add &lt;name&gt; &lt;url&gt;     Add a new remote
  list                 List all configured remotes
  remove &lt;name&gt;        Remove a remote
  reset-data &lt;name&gt;    Replace a remote's data plane after a history squash

```
bd dolt remote [command]
```

### bd dolt remote add

Add a Dolt remote

```
bd dolt remote add <name> <url> [flags]
```

**Flags:**

```
      --allow-git-origin   Allow adding a Dolt remote whose URL matches the git origin (proceed with a warning instead of aborting)
```

### bd dolt remote list

List configured Dolt remotes

```
bd dolt remote list [flags]
```

### bd dolt remote remove

Remove a Dolt remote

```
bd dolt remote remove <name> [flags]
```

### bd dolt remote reset-data

Replace a Dolt remote's stored data with a fresh copy of local HEAD.

After a history squash (see the History Bloat recovery runbook), a plain
'bd dolt push --force' re-points the remote's refs but deletes nothing:
Dolt remotes accumulate chunks monotonically, so the remote keeps the full
pre-squash store. This command rebuilds the remote's data plane so it holds
only live chunks:

  - Git-backed remotes (issue data riding a git remote under refs/dolt/data):
    deletes the Dolt data refs on the git remote, then force-pushes to
    rebuild a fresh store. Code branches are untouched.
  - Native file remotes (file:// paths): clears the store directory, then
    force-pushes to rebuild it.
  - Cloud/hosted remotes (aws://, gs://, dolthub://, ...): bd cannot clear
    the stored data safely — replace the remote with a fresh URL or prefix:
      bd dolt remote remove &lt;name&gt;
      bd dolt remote add &lt;name&gt; &lt;fresh-url&gt;
      bd dolt push --force

This rewrites the remote's data plane. Every other clone must re-clone from
the reset remote (that is already true after the squash itself). Refuses to
run with uncommitted working-set changes: the rebuilt remote holds exactly
HEAD, and anything uncommitted would not be part of it.

Examples:
  bd dolt remote reset-data origin          # prompts for confirmation
  bd dolt remote reset-data origin --yes    # no prompt (scripts, agents)

```
bd dolt remote reset-data <name> [flags]
```

**Flags:**

```
  -y, --yes   Skip the confirmation prompt (required in non-interactive use)
```

## bd dolt set

Set a Dolt configuration value in metadata.json.

Keys:
  database  Database name (default: issue prefix or "beads")
  host      Server host (default: 127.0.0.1)
  port      Server port (auto-detected; override with bd dolt set port &lt;N&gt;)
  user      MySQL user (default: root)
  data-dir  Custom dolt data directory (absolute path; default: .beads/dolt)

There is no 'password' or 'tls' key here on purpose — secrets and TLS must
not land in metadata.json. Use environment variables or the credentials file:

  BEADS_DOLT_PASSWORD     Server password (highest priority)
  BEADS_DOLT_SERVER_TLS   Enable TLS ("1" or "true")
  BEADS_CREDENTIALS_FILE  Optional override path for credentials

  Default credentials file: ~/.config/beads/credentials
  Format:
    [host:port]
    password = secret

  See: bd dolt --help and docs/architecture/dolt.md

Use --update-config to also write to config.yaml for team-wide defaults.

Examples:
  bd dolt set database myproject
  bd dolt set host 192.168.1.100
  bd dolt set port 3307 --update-config
  bd dolt set data-dir /home/user/.beads-dolt/myproject
  `export BEADS_DOLT_PASSWORD=... BEADS_DOLT_SERVER_TLS=1`

```
bd dolt set <key> <value> [flags]
```

**Flags:**

```
      --update-config   Also write to config.yaml for team-wide defaults
```

## bd dolt show

Show current Dolt configuration with connection status

```
bd dolt show [flags]
```

## bd dolt start

Start a dolt sql-server for the current beads project.

The server runs in the background on a per-project port derived from the
project path. PID and logs are stored in .beads/.

The server auto-starts transparently when needed, so manual start is rarely
required. Use this command for explicit control or diagnostics.

```
bd dolt start [flags]
```

## bd dolt status

Show the status of the Dolt engine for the current project.

In embedded mode, reports that the Dolt engine runs in-process and shows
the on-disk data directory. For beads-managed (local) servers, displays
PID, port, and data directory from the local PID file. For externally-
managed servers — a shared server (dolt.shared-server: true), a remote
dolt_server_host, or a local server managed outside bd (dolt.auto-start:
false, e.g. an orchestrator-shared sql-server) — pings the configured
endpoint via SQL and reports reachability, server version, and database.

```
bd dolt status [flags]
```

## bd dolt stop

Stop the dolt sql-server managed by beads for the current project.

This sends a graceful shutdown signal. The server will restart automatically
on the next bd command unless auto-start is disabled.

For a managed proxied server, --force can recover unverifiable or legacy
process records (both the proxy and its backend) only after each live process
executable is matched to bd or dolt and its command line ties it to this
workspace. In that recovery path, force still refuses to signal a process
whose executable identity cannot be matched to bd or dolt, or whose workspace
scope cannot be established.

```
bd dolt stop [flags]
```

**Flags:**

```
      --force   Force stop (proxied recovery still requires a bd/dolt executable match)
```

## bd dolt test

Test the connection to the configured Dolt server.

This verifies that:
  1. The server is reachable at the configured host:port
  2. The connection can be established

Use this before switching to server mode to ensure the server is running.

```
bd dolt test [flags]
```
